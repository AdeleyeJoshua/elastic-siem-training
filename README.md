## 💡 Learning Approach

**Documentation Philosophy:**
- Capture investigation methodology, not just results
- Explain query logic and reasoning
- Document mistakes and refinements
- Focus on real-world SOC applications
- Build reusable resources for future reference

**Practical Focus:**
All documented work represents hands-on labs with measurable outputs - queries written, threats detected, alerts investigated, and timelines reconstructed.
