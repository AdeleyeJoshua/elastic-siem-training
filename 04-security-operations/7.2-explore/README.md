---

## üîç Investigation Process

### 1. Understanding the Explore Interface

**Discovery:**  
The Explore section serves as the central hub for security data analysis in Elastic Security. It provides comprehensive overview pages organized by:
- **Hosts** - System-level activity and endpoint security
- **Network** - Traffic patterns and network-based detections
- **Users** - Authentication events and user behavior
- **Alerts** - Security detections from various sources

**Why This Matters:**  
In a SOC environment, the Explore interface is your primary entry point for proactive threat hunting and initial triage of security events.

---

### 2. Host Analysis

**Objective:** Understand endpoint visibility in the environment

**What I Explored:**
- Reviewed the Hosts tab to view system information
- Examined hostnames, operating systems, and security event associations
- Analyzed host activity levels through visualizations

**Key Insight:**  
The Hosts page provides a quick overview of endpoint activity, allowing analysts to identify potentially compromised systems or unusual behavior patterns at the host level.

**Real-World Application:**  
During incident response, this view helps quickly identify which hosts are generating security events and may require deeper investigation.

---

### 3. Network Traffic Analysis - Day 1 Alerts

**Objective:** Analyze network-based security detections

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Navigated to:** Explore ‚Üí Network
2. **Adjusted timepicker to:** Day 1
3. **Filtered to:** Show only external alerts (Events tab)
4. **Observed:** Total number of alerts at bottom of page

**Finding:**  
Identified the volume of external alerts generated during Day 1, establishing a baseline for network-based detections.

**Analysis Technique:**  
Focusing on external alerts helps prioritize threats from outside the network perimeter, which often represent higher-risk activities (scanning, exploitation attempts, C2 communication).

---

### 4. Alert Source Identification - Suricata vs. Zeek

**Objective:** Determine which detection tool generated the most alerts

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Examined:** External alert trend visualization
2. **Focused on:** `event.module` field
3. **Identified:** Suricata as the primary alert source

**Finding:**  
**Suricata** was responsible for the majority of alerts during the observed timeframe.

**Follow-up Analysis:**
- Filtered out Suricata alerts to isolate remaining detections
- Confirmed **Zeek** generated a smaller but distinct set of alerts

**Why This Matters:**  
Understanding which tools are generating alerts helps with:
- **Alert triage prioritization** - Different tools have different false positive rates
- **Detection coverage gaps** - If one tool is silent, it may indicate misconfiguration
- **Investigation context** - Suricata focuses on signatures, while Zeek provides protocol analysis

**Query Logic (Conceptual):**
```kql
// View all external alerts
event.category: "alert" AND network.direction: "external"

// Filter by detection tool
event.module: "suricata"
event.module: "zeek"
```

### 5. DNS Analysis - Most Queried Domain

**Objective:** Identify potentially suspicious or high-volume DNS activity

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Navigated to:** Network ‚Üí DNS tab (Day 1 timeframe)
2. **Analyzed:** Top 10 DNS Domain visualization
3. **Identified top domain:** `moatads.com`

**Finding:**  
**moatads.com** had the highest number of DNS queries during Day 1.

**Context Analysis:**  
- `moatads.com` is associated with advertising tracking and analytics
- High query volume could indicate:
  - Normal web browsing with ad-heavy sites
  - Potential ad-tracking infrastructure
  - Baseline for distinguishing legitimate vs. malicious DNS patterns

**Threat Hunting Consideration:**  
While this domain appears benign, the methodology applies to identifying:
- Command & Control (C2) beaconing via DNS
- DNS tunneling for data exfiltration
- Domains with abnormally high query counts

**Query Logic (Conceptual):**
```kql
// Top DNS queries by domain
event.category: "network" AND network.protocol: "dns"
| stats count() by dns.question.name
| sort count desc
| limit 10
```

---

### 6. HTTP Traffic Analysis - Most Requested Path

**Objective:** Analyze HTTP request patterns for suspicious activity

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Examined:** HTTP section visualization
2. **Reviewed:** Domains and request counts
3. **Identified:** Most requested URL path: `/ping`

**Finding:**  
The domain with the highest HTTP request count had the path **/ping** as its most frequently accessed endpoint.

**Analysis:**  
- `/ping` endpoints are commonly used for health checks and monitoring
- High frequency could indicate:
  - Legitimate application monitoring
  - Load balancer health checks
  - Potential reconnaissance or service enumeration

**Security Implications:**  
Understanding normal HTTP patterns helps identify:
- Web application attacks (SQL injection, XSS attempts)
- Scanning/enumeration activities
- Data exfiltration via HTTP
- C2 communication disguised as web traffic

**Query Logic (Conceptual):**
```kql
// Top HTTP request paths
event.category: "network" AND network.protocol: "http"
| stats count() by url.path, destination.domain
| sort count desc
```

---

### 7. User Authentication Analysis - Failed Login Detection

**Objective:** Identify potential brute force attacks or compromised credentials

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Navigated to:** Explore ‚Üí Users
2. **Adjusted timepicker to:** BLISTER (specific time range)
3. **Examined:** Authentication visualization
4. **Filtered for:** Failed authentication attempts
5. **Identified:** User with most failed authentications

**Finding:**  
One specific user account had significantly more failed authentication attempts than others during the BLISTER timeframe.

**Security Analysis:**  
High failed authentication counts can indicate:
- **Brute force attack** - Automated password guessing
- **Credential stuffing** - Testing leaked credentials
- **User behavior issues** - Forgotten passwords (less likely if extreme volume)
- **Compromised account** - Attacker attempting to regain access

**Investigation Next Steps (Real-World):**
1. Check source IPs of failed attempts (single vs. distributed)
2. Review time distribution (rapid succession vs. sporadic)
3. Determine if any attempts succeeded
4. Correlate with other user activity (lateral movement, privilege escalation)
5. Check for account lockouts or security alerts

**Query Logic (Conceptual):**
```kql
// Failed authentication attempts by user
event.category: "authentication" AND event.outcome: "failure"
| stats count() by user.name, source.ip
| sort count desc
```

**Real-World Response:**
- Immediate: Verify account hasn't been compromised
- Short-term: Reset credentials, enable MFA if not present
- Long-term: Implement account lockout policies, monitor for similar patterns
